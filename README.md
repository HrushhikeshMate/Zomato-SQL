# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

-- 2. Creating Tables
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_item VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
);
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.
```sql
select max(order_date) from orders; --2024-01-25
-- join cx and orders
-- filter for last 1 year 
-- FILTER 'arjun mehta'
-- group by cx id, dishes, cnt

SELECT  o.order_item, count(o.order_item) as order_count  FROM customers c
join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
where c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
group by  o.order_item
order by order_count DESC
limit 6;

SELECT 
	customer_name,
	dishes,
	total_orders
FROM -- table name
	(SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.customer_name,
		o.order_item as dishes,
		COUNT(*) as total_orders,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rank
	FROM orders as o
	JOIN
	customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	WHERE 
		o.order_date >= DATE '2024-01-25' - INTERVAL '1 Year'
		AND 
		c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
	ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC) as t1
WHERE rank <= 5;
```
### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 + 2 as end_time,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

**Approach 2:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
      - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql
SELECT 
	-- o.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	AVG(o.total_amount) as aov
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING  COUNT(order_id) > 750;
```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!

```sql
SELECT 
	-- o.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 100000;
```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_name,
	COUNT(o.order_id) as cnt_not_delivered_orders
FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN 
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN
deliveries as d
ON d.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE d.delivery_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

-- Approach 2
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_name,
	COUNT(*)
FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN 
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
WHERE 
	o.order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id FROM deliveries)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```


### 6. Restaurant Revenue Ranking: 
-- Rank restaurants by their total revenue from the last year, including their name, 
-- total revenue, and rank within their city.

```sql
WITH ranking_table
AS
(
	SELECT 
		r.city,
		r.restaurant_name,
		SUM(o.total_amount) as revenue,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) as rank
	FROM orders as o
	JOIN 
	restaurants as r
	ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
	WHERE o.order_date >= DATE '2024-01-25' - INTERVAL '1 year'
	GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
	*
FROM ranking_table
WHERE rank = 1;

```

### 7. Most Popular Dish by City: 
-- Identify the most popular dish in each city based on the number of orders.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM
(SELECT 
	r.city,
	o.order_item as dish,
	COUNT(order_id) as total_orders,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) DESC) as rank
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 8. Customer Churn: 
-- Find customers who havenâ€™t placed an order in 2024 but did in 2023.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
WHERE 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
	AND
	customer_id NOT IN 
					(SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
					WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2024);
```

### 9. Cancellation Rate Comparison: 
-- Calculate and compare the order cancellation rate for each restaurant between the 
-- current year and the previous year
```sql
WITH cancel_ratio_23 AS (
    SELECT 
        o.restaurant_id,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN d.delivery_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_delivered
    FROM orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN deliveries AS d
    ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY o.restaurant_id
),
cancel_ratio_24 AS (
    SELECT 
        o.restaurant_id,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN d.delivery_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_delivered
    FROM orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN deliveries AS d
    ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2024
    GROUP BY o.restaurant_id
),
last_year_data AS (
    SELECT 
        restaurant_id,
        total_orders,
        not_delivered,
        ROUND((not_delivered::numeric / total_orders::numeric) * 100, 2) AS cancel_ratio
    FROM cancel_ratio_23
),
current_year_data AS (
    SELECT 
        restaurant_id,
        total_orders,
        not_delivered,
        ROUND((not_delivered::numeric / total_orders::numeric) * 100, 2) AS cancel_ratio
    FROM cancel_ratio_24
)	
SELECT 
    c.restaurant_id AS restaurant_id,
    c.cancel_ratio AS current_year_cancel_ratio,
    l.cancel_ratio AS last_year_cancel_ratio
FROM current_year_data AS c
JOIN last_year_data AS l
ON c.restaurant_id = l.restaurant_id;
```
